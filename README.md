# Civbuilder
  Welcome to CivBuilder, the ultimate civilization clicker game. You can build intergalactic human civilizations to planet eating caterpillars, and much more. This game provides the best experience when played on a Chromebook Chrome and in full-size mode. I devote this game to honorable YHIMS students. Enjoy!
